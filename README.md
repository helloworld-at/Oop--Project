# Oop--Project
This is a final project of object oriented programming
This project implements the concepts like abstraction,interfaces,inheritance
the Airplane Reservation System we've built is an interactive console application that simulates the process of booking a flight, allowing users to input passenger and flight details, view available seats, and make payments. It also offers some additional features like displaying flight timings and providing special assistance options.
This system encapsulates key aspects of a flight reservation system, such as:
Passenger and Flight details: The system maintains information about passengers and flights, which are fundamental to any reservation system.
Booking: The system enables the user to make a booking by providing passenger details and choosing a flight.
Payments: Our system simulates a simple payment process. While it's straightforward for this demonstration, in a real-world system, this would be a much more complex process with various payment options and security measures.
Special Assistance: The system also provides an option for users to request additional assistance services, demonstrating how such systems can be tailored to accommodate a wide range of passenger needs.
Flight Timing: The system offers flight timing options, reflecting the fact that real-world airline systems often offer multiple flights to the same destination at different times.
